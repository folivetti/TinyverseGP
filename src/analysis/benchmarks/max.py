"""
Implements the MAX problem which is one of the benchmarks that is commonly used
for analysis of GP.

The aim of MAX is to find a program that returns the largest possible as output
given a maximum depth D and a constant (terminal) value t.

The maximum output is the ideal fitness of the formulated GP search problem.

There are two version of MAX that are implemented in this problem class:
    - max-{+}-D-t :
        MAX with maximum depth D, constant t and function set F = {+} (MaxPlus)

    - max-{+,*}-D-t :
        MAX with maximum depth D, constant t and function set F = {+, *} (MaxPlusMul)

This implementation of MAX supports log scaling to enable evaluation of MAX on large settings
of the depth D.
